# **Sales and Customer Insights: SQL Analysis of Scale Model Car Store**

## **Project Overview**

Data analysis is a critical tool in optimising business decisions. This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract actionable insights from a sales records database of a scale model car store. The goal is to support decision-making around inventory management, customer engagement, and marketing strategy by analysing sales performance and customer behaviour.

## **Business Questions**

This project focuses on answering three key business questions:

1. **Which products should we order more of or less of?**

   * Identify low-stock products and assess their sales performance to prioritise restocking.

2. **How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviour?**

   * Categorise customers into VIPs and less-engaged segments to guide targeted marketing campaigns.

3. **How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?**

   * Compute the Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) to inform spending on customer acquisition and predict future revenue.

## **Database Schema**

The analysis uses a sales database with the following tables:

| Table Name   | Description                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Customers    | Customer details, including contact info |
| Employees    | Employee records                         |
| Offices      | Sales office information                 |
| Orders       | Customer order data                      |
| OrderDetails | Individual items within each order       |
| Payments     | Customer payment records                 |
| Products     | Scale model car products                 |
| ProductLines | Product line categories                  |

---

## **Approach**

1. **Inventory Analysis (Question 1)**

   * Compute low stock for each product using a correlated subquery: `SUM(quantityOrdered) / quantityInStock`.
   * Compute product performance using `SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach)` to measure revenue per product.
   * Combine both metrics using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to identify priority products for restocking.

2. **Customer Segmentation (Question 2)**

   * Calculate profit per customer using `SUM(quantityOrdered * (priceEach - buyPrice))`.
   * Identify the top 5 VIP customers and the bottom 5 least-engaged customers using CTEs.
   * Highlight opportunities for personalised marketing strategies to drive loyalty and engagement.

3. **Customer Acquisition Insights (Question 3)**

   * Compute the Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) as the average profit per customer.
   * Use LTV to determine the budget available for acquiring new customers and projecting future revenue.

## **Key SQL Techniques Used**

* Joins (`INNER JOIN`) across multiple tables
* Aggregation functions (`SUM`, `AVG`)
* Grouping (`GROUP BY`) and ordering (`ORDER BY`)
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular, readable queries
* Correlated subqueries for product inventory calculations
* Filtering using the `IN` operator for combined CTE outputs

## **Insights & Results**

### **1. Priority Products for Restocking**

The following products require immediate restocking due to high performance and low stock:

| Product Name             | Product Line |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1968 Ford Mustang        | Classic Cars |
| 1911 Ford Town Car       | Vintage Cars |
| 1928 Mercedes-Benz SSK   | Vintage Cars |
| 1960 BSA Gold Star DBD34 | Motorcycles  |
| 1997 BMW F650 ST         | Motorcycles  |
| 1928 Ford Phaeton Deluxe | Vintage Cars |
| 2002 Yamaha YZR M1       | Motorcycles  |
| The Mayflower            | Ships        |
| F/A 18 Hornet 1/72       | Planes       |
| Pont Yacht               | Ships        |

### **2. Customer Segmentation**

**VIP Customers:**

| Name           | City       | Country   | Profit ($) |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Diego Freyre   | Madrid     | Spain     | 326,519.66 |
| Susan Nelson   | San Rafael | USA       | 236,769.39 |
| Jeff Young     | NYC        | USA       | 72,370.09  |
| Peter Ferguson | Melbourne  | Australia | 70,311.07  |
| Janine Labrune | Nantes     | France    | 60,875.30  |

**Least-Engaged Customers:**

| Name           | City       | Country | Profit ($) |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Mary Young     | Glendale   | USA     | 2,610.87   |
| Leslie Taylor  | Brickhaven | USA     | 6,586.02   |
| Franco Ricotti | Milan      | Italy   | 9,532.93   |
| Carine Schmitt | Nantes     | France  | 10,063.80  |
| Thomas Smith   | London     | UK      | 10,868.04  |

### **3. Customer Acquisition & LTV**

* **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** $39,039.59
* This represents the average profit generated by a single customer over their lifetime with the store.
* Example: Acquiring 10 new customers next month could generate $390,395 in revenue, guiding the marketing budget for customer acquisition campaigns.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates a complete cycle of business intelligence analysis using SQL:

* **Inventory Management:** Identified top-performing products at risk of stockout.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Determined VIP and less-engaged customer profiles to optimise marketing strategies.
* **Revenue Forecasting & Customer Acquisition:** Calculated LTV to inform acquisition spending and predict future profits.

The approach showcases the ability to combine technical SQL expertise with business strategy insights, providing actionable recommendations for data-driven decision-making in a retail environment.
